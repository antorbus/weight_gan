# weight_gan

The notebook contains an simple GAN that generates the weights of another network so that it achives high performance on MNIST. 
After developing the GAN I was thinking of scaling it, however after doing some research I found out that GANs that generate the 
weights of another network already exsisted, and are called HyperGANs. So I stopped working on this.
